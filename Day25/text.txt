Imagine you are the curator of a historic library, where books are arranged in a 
unique catalog system based on their publication years. The library’s archive is 
structured like a hierarchical tree, with each book’s publication year stored at 
a node. You are given the nodes of this catalog tree starting with main node
and a list of query years.

For each query year, you need to find two publication years:
- The first is the latest year in the archive that is less than or equal to the 
  query year. If no such book exists, use -1.
- The second is the earliest year in the archive that is greater than or equal 
  to the query year. If no such book exists, use -1.

Display the results as an list of pairs, where each pair corresponds to a query.

Example 1:
----------
Input: 
2006 2002 2013 2001 2004 2009 2015 2014
2002 2005 2016

Output:
[[2002, 2002], [2004, 2006], [2015, -1]] 


Archive Structure:
          2006
         /    \
     2002     2013
     /   \     /   \
  2001  2004  2009  2015
                     /
                  2014
                  
Explanation:  
- For the query 2002, the latest publication year that is ≤ 2002 is 2002, and 
  the earliest publication year that is ≥ 2002 is also 2002.  
- For the query 2005, the latest publication year that is ≤ 2005 is 2004, and 
  the earliest publication year that is ≥ 2005 is 2006.  
- For the query 2016, the latest publication year that is ≤ 2016 is 2015, but 
  there is no publication year ≥ 2016, so we output -1 for the second value.

Example 2:
----------
Input:  
2004 2009
2003

Output:
[[-1, 2004]]

Explanation:  
- For the query 2003, there is no publication year ≤ 2003, while the earliest 
  publication year that is ≥ 2003 is 2004.

Constraints:
- The total number of books in the archive is in the range [2, 10^5].
- Each publication year is between 1 and 10^6.
- The number of queries n is in the range [1, 10^5].
- Each query year is between 1 and 10^6.
