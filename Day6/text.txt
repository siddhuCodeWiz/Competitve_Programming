Given the preorder and postorder traversals of a binary tree, construct 
the original binary tree and print its level order traversal.

Input Format:
---------------
Space separated integers, pre order data
Space separated integers, post order data

Output Format:
-----------------
Print the level-order data of the tree.

Balbir Singh is working with Binary Trees.
The elements of the tree are given in level-order format.

Balbir is observing the tree from the right side, meaning he 
can only see the rightmost nodes (one node per level).

You are given the root of a binary tree. Your task is to determine 
the nodes visible from the right side and return them in top-to-bottom order.

Input Format:
-------------
Space separated integers, elements of the tree.

Output Format:
--------------
A list of integers representing the node values visible from the right side


Sample Input-1:
---------------
1 2 3 5 -1 -1 5

Sample Output-1:
----------------
[1, 3, 5]



Sample Input-2:
---------------
3 2 4 3 2

Sample Output-2:
----------------
[3, 4, 2]






The Indian Army has established multiple military camps at strategic locations 
along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Galwan. These camps are connected in 
a hierarchical structure, with a main base camp acting as the root of the network.

To fortify national security, the Government of India has planned to deploy 
a protective S.H.I.E.L.D. that encloses all military camps forming the outer 
boundary of the network.

Structure of Military Camps:
    - Each military camp is uniquely identified by an integer ID.
    - A camp can have at most two direct connections:
        - Left connection → Represents a subordinate camp on the left.
        - Right connection → Represents a subordinate camp on the right.
    - If a military camp does not exist at a specific position, it is 
      represented by -1
	
Mission: Deploying the S.H.I.E.L.D.
Your task is to determine the list of military camp IDs forming the outer 
boundary of the military network. This boundary must be traversed in 
anti-clockwise order, starting from the main base camp (root).

The boundary consists of:
1. The main base camp (root).
2. The left boundary:
    - Starts from the root’s left child and follows the leftmost path downwards.
    - If a camp has a left connection, follow it.
    - If no left connection exists but a right connection does, follow the right connection.
    - The leftmost leaf camp is NOT included in this boundary.
3. The leaf camps (i.e., camps with no further connections), ordered from left to right.
4. The right boundary (in reverse order):
    - Starts from the root’s right child and follows the rightmost path downwards.
    - If a camp has a right connection, follow it.
    - If no right connection exists but a left connection does, follow the left connection.
    - The rightmost leaf camp is NOT included in this boundary.


Input Format:
-------------
space separated integers, military-camp IDs.

Output Format:
--------------
Print all the military-camp IDs, which are at the edge of S.H.I.E.L.D.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
5 2 4 7 9 8 1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
[5, 2, 7, 9, 8, 1, 4]


Sample Input-2:
---------------
11 2 13 4 25 6 -1 -1 -1 7 18 9 10

Sample Output-2:
----------------
[11, 2, 4, 7, 18, 9, 10, 6, 13]


Sample Input-3:
---------------
1 2 3 -1 -1 -1 5 -1 6 7

Sample Output-3:
----------------
[1, 2, 7, 6, 5, 3]
