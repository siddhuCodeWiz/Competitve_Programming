Given the in-order and post-order traversals of a binary tree, construct 
the original binary tree. For the given Q number of queries, 
each query consists of a lower level and an upper level. 
The output should list the nodes in the order they appear in a level-wise.

Input Format:
-------------
An integer N representing the number nodes.
A space-separated list of N integers representing the similar to in-order traversal.
A space-separated list of N integers representing the similar to post-order traversal.
An integer Q representing the number of queries.
Q pairs of integers, each representing a query in the form:
Lower level (L)
Upper level (U)

Output Format:
For each query, print the nodes in order within the given depth range

Example
Input:
7
4 2 5 1 6 3 7
4 5 2 6 7 3 1
2
1 2
2 3
Output:
[1, 2, 3]
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

/*Construct the binary tree from the given In-order and Pre-order. 
Find Nodes Between Two Levels in Spiral Order.
The spiral order is as follows:
-> Odd levels → Left to Right.
-> Even levels → Right to Left.

Input Format:
--------------
An integer N representing the number of nodes.
A space-separated list of N integers representing the in-order traversal.
A space-separated list of N integers representing the pre-order traversal.
Two integers:
Lower Level (L)
Upper Level (U)

Output Format:
Print all nodes within the specified levels, but in spiral order.

Example:
Input:
7
4 2 5 1 6 3 7
1 2 4 5 3 6 7
2 3

Output:
3 2 4 5 6 7

Levels 2 to 3 in Regular Order:
Level 2 → 2 3
Level 3 → 4 5 6 7

Spiral Order:
Level 2 (Even) → 3 2 (Right to Left)
Level 3 (Odd) → 4 5 6 7 (Left to Right)
