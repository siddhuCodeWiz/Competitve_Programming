In networking, a subnet is a portion of a network with a defined range of IP addresses. 
Two subnets overlap if they share some common IP addresses. Given two network 
IP addresses with their respective CIDR notations, write a program that determines 
whether these subnets overlap.

Your program should take as input:

IP1: The first subnet’s network address.
CIDR1: The CIDR notation (prefix length) for the first subnet.
IP2: The second subnet’s network address.
CIDR2: The CIDR notation (prefix length) for the second subnet.
The program should return true if the subnets overlap and false otherwise.

Input Format:
-------------
A string IP1: The first network IP address (e.g., "192.168.1.0").
An integer CIDR1: The subnet mask prefix (e.g., 24 for /24).
A string IP2: The second network IP address (e.g., "192.168.1.128").
An integer CIDR2: The subnet mask prefix for the second subnet.

Output Format:
--------------
A boolean value, if the two subnets overlap or not.


Sample Input:
-------------
192.168.1.0
24
192.168.1.128
25

Sample Output:
--------------
true

Explanation:
------------
A /26 subnet has 64 IP addresses. The starting addresses of 
the first four subnets are:
192.168.1.0
192.168.1.64
192.168.1.128
192.168.1.192


Sample Input:
-------------
10.0.0.0
16
10.1.0.0
16

Sample Output:
--------------
false
