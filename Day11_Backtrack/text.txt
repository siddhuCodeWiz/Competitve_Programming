A shipping company is managing two cargo ships: a large cargo ship and 
a smaller cargo ship. The company has divided the large cargo ship into 
X compartments and the smaller cargo ship into Y compartments, where X > Y.

Each compartment in both ships is loaded with a specific amount of cargo. 
The company needs to relocate cargo from the large cargo ship to the smaller 
cargo ship by selecting Y compartments from the large ship and transferring 
their cargo to Y compartments in the smaller ship, maintaining the respective order.

However, due to weight balance regulations, the amount in compartment n+1 
should always be greater than or equal to that in the compartment n of the smaller 
cargo ship, after the transferred from the large cargo ship.

Your task is to help the company determine the number of ways they can transfer 
the cargo while satisfying these regulations.

Input Format:
-------------
Number of compartments in the large cargo ship (X).
Number of compartments in the smaller cargo ship (Y).
Cargo weights in compartments of the large cargo ship.
Cargo weights in compartments of the smaller cargo ship.

Output Format:
----------------
Return the number of valid ways to transfer the cargo.


Sample Input:
--------------
5
3
1 5 2 4 7
7 8 6

Sample Output:
----------------
4

Explanation:
-----------
The compartments from the large cargo ship can be selected as:
- (1, 2, 7)
- (1, 4, 7)
- (5, 4, 7)
- (2, 4, 7)  
Thus, there are 4 valid ways to transfer the cargo.

Sample Input:
--------------
4
2
7 7 7 7
3 4

Sample Output:
----------------
6

Explanation:
-----------
The compartments from the large cargo ship can be selected as:
- (1st, 2nd) (7,7)
- (1st, 3rd) (7,7)
- (1st, 4th) (7,7)
- (2nd, 3rd) (7,7)
- (2nd, 4th) (7,7)
- (3rd, 4th) (7,7)  

Thus, there are 6 valid ways to transfer the cargo.


















Imagine you're an archivist in the ancient Kingdom of Numeria, tasked with 
recording the royal lineage on a sacred scroll. Every monarch is identified 
by a unique number, and the family tree unfolds in a very specific way. 
Your mission is to transcribe this dynasty using a method that adheres 
to the following customs:

Royal Inscription:  
- Each monarch’s unique number is written as their signature on the scroll.

Enclosing Descendants:  
- If a monarch has offspring, their descendants must be recorded inside parentheses 
  immediately following the monarch’s number.
    - The first-born (or primary heir) is enclosed in its own set of parentheses.
    - If there is a second-born, their number is similarly enclosed, following 
      the first-born’s parentheses.

Omitting Redundant Markings:  
- Empty pairs of parentheses are generally left off the scroll to keep the record neat.
- However, if a monarch has a second-born but first-born is no more, you must include 
  an empty pair of parentheses to clearly mark the absence of a primary heir—ensuring 
  the lineage is accurately mapped.

Your task is to create such an inscription that perfectly reflects the 
hierarchical structure of the royal lineage.

Example 1:
Input=
1 2 3 4
Output=
1(2(4))(3)

Explanation:
        1
       / \
      2   3
     /    
    4

- Monarch 1 is the founding ruler. He has two heirs: Monarch 2 (first-born) and 
  Monarch 3 (second-born).
- Monarch 2 has a single descendant, Monarch 4, recorded as his first-born.
- Since empty markings for non-existent descendants are omitted (because they 
  don't add any information), the inscription is kept concise.
- Thus, the final transcription on the sacred scroll is: "1(2(4))(3)"

Example 2:
Input=
1 2 3 -1 4
Output=
1(2()(4))(3)

Explanation:
        1
       / \
      2   3
       \
        4

- Monarch 1 is the founding ruler with two heirs: Monarch 2 and Monarch 3.
- In this dynasty, Monarch 2 first-born is no more alive but does have a younger 
  descendant, Monarch 4.
- To ensure the record accurately reflects the gap in succession for Monarch 2, 
  an empty pair of parentheses is added before representing Monarch 4. 
  This explicitly marks the absence of a first-born heir.
- Therefore, the recorded inscription becomes: "1(2()(4))(3)"

Example 3:
input=
1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7
output=
1(2(4()(7)))(3(5)(6))











Imagine you are designing a network of secret corridors in an ancient castle. 
Each chamber in the castle leads to at most two other chambers through 
hidden passageways, forming a branching layout. 
The castle’s "longest secret route" is defined as the maximum number of corridors 
you must traverse to get from one chamber to another (without repeating the corridor). 
This route may or may not pass through the main entry chamber.

Your task is to compute the length of longest secret route between 
two chambers which is represented by the number of corridors between them.

Example 1
input=
1 2 3 4 5 
output=
3

Structure:
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   4   5

Explanation:
The longest secret route from chamber 4 to chamber 3 
(alternatively, from chamber 5 to chamber 3) along the route:
4 → 2 → 1 → 3
This path has 3 corridors (4–2, 2–1, 1–3), so the length is 3.

Example 2:
input=
1 -1 2 3 4
output=
2

Structure:
   1
    \
     2
    / \
   3   4

Explanation:
The longest secret route from chamber 3 to chamber 4 
(alternatively, from chamber 1 to chamber 4) along the route:
3 → 2 → 4
This path has 2 corridors (3–2, 2–4), so the length is 2.
